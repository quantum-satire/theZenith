In the simpler days of old, a rumor would spread through a small town with the swiftness of a diving hawk. So too did one spread in the 21st century newsroom of The Zenith. Robert Floyd's hands trembled in his lap as he sat facing an empty desk, the wrong side of the editor-in-chief. He tugged at the sleeves of his grey suit and drew in a deep breath through his nose, his leg bouncing as the other supporting leg tapped nervously against the old worn carpet.
The door to the accomodating office opened with a soft squeak from the old brass hinges holding the heavy wood to the wall; Floyd craned his neck to glance at his editor in order to study the other man's body language. He read anger and a tinge of resentment.
"I know you've heard what's been going on, but I just wanted to tell you first that I--"
"How long have you been working in this newsroom?" interjected the balding editor, caterpillar brows furrowing in the center to form one long parabola of grey fur. Floyd swallowed his words and donned a more tentative tone.
"Six years."
"Then you will obviously understand our policy on plagarism?"
Floyd blinked. "Plagarism?"
"Yes, plagarism. This is… something I have never had to deal with in my thirty years of working for this company. Do you realize what you've done to our reputation..." The man trailed off as he looked down to his desk, moving aside a paper to read off of another. "Robert, is it?"
"I don't believe you understand the situation Mr. Goodfellow, this is not--"
"You've thrown it into the trash bin!" Goodfellow exclaimed as he continued on his chastisement, disregarding Floyd's objection. "This will take weeks' worth of reparations to our readers and thousands of dollars in lawyer fees. Just when I thought I could retire at the peak of productivity, *you* had to come through and… and utterly wreck my work! Of course you're fired immediately, as far as prosecution and charges go I will have to meet with my..."
The editor's words droned out of focus as Floyd's mind began to run wild. "No no no, you don't understand. You don't understand what's going on here!" He leapt from his chair, startling the much shorter Goodfellow on the other side of the desk. "I've been framed for this!"
"You haven't been framed for shit!" counteracted the now red-faced man with a certain poison to his tone that would cause a current employee to keep their mouth shut. Floyd had nothing to lose with where his job was concerned at this point.

The in-house security guards had to drag him out by the time the meeting was over. It didn't last very long after Floyd had begun to speak his mind about The Zenith's treatment of his work, and in the back of his mind he almost felt relieved that he would no longer have to endure the job. On the forefront of his thought however was the more practical "holy hell, my career's been destroyed and I don't know how I'm going to make enough to eat." The starving artist look never appealed to him, even in college.
